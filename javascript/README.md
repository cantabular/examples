## Cantabular GraphQL API JavaScript example

An example script to get output from Cantabular's GraphQL API and restructure it for use in JavaScript applications.

The script has a single dependency on `node-fetch` to allow the script to be run in NodeJS.

To use the script in the browser, you can remove the dependency and the line in the script that includes it:

```
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
```

## Install dependencies and run example code

```
npm install
npm run example
```
